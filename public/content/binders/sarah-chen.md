# Meet Sarah Chen

## About Me

Hello! I'm Sarah Chen, a passionate digital storyteller who bridges the gap between traditional narrative and cutting-edge technology. With over 8 years of experience in multimedia publishing, I specialize in creating immersive, interactive stories that captivate and engage modern audiences.

## My Journey

My journey into digital storytelling began during my graduate studies in Interactive Media Design at Stanford University. What started as curiosity about how technology could enhance narrative experiences has evolved into a career dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what stories can be.

### Background & Education

- **M.A. Interactive Media Design** - Stanford University (2016)
- **B.A. English Literature** - UC Berkeley (2014)
- **Certificate in UX Design** - General Assembly (2017)

## What I Do

I create digital narratives that combine:

- **Interactive Elements**: Choose-your-own-adventure style storytelling
- **Multimedia Integration**: Seamlessly blending text, audio, and visual elements
- **Responsive Design**: Stories that adapt to different devices and reading preferences
- **User Experience Focus**: Ensuring every interaction enhances the narrative

## My Publishing Philosophy

> "Every story deserves to be told in the medium that best serves its purpose. Sometimes that's a traditional book, sometimes it's an interactive digital experience, and often it's something entirely new."

I believe in:

- **Reader Agency**: Giving readers meaningful choices in how they experience stories
- **Accessibility**: Creating inclusive narratives that welcome all audiences
- **Innovation**: Constantly exploring new ways to tell timeless stories
- **Collaboration**: Working with other creators to push creative boundaries
