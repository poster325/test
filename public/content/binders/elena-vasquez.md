# Meet Elena Vasquez

## About Me

¬°Hola! I'm Elena Vasquez, a passionate historian and storyteller dedicated to bringing forgotten voices from the past to life through immersive historical fiction. Based in Barcelona, I specialize in Mediterranean history and cultural heritage preservation through narrative.

## My Calling

I believe that history is not just about dates and events‚Äîit's about the human stories that connect us across time. My mission is to uncover and share the experiences of ordinary people who lived through extraordinary times, especially those whose stories have been overlooked or forgotten.

### Background & Education

- **Ph.D. Medieval History** - Universitat de Barcelona (2018)
- **M.A. Cultural Heritage Management** - Universidad Complutense Madrid (2015)
- **B.A. History & Linguistics** - Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (2013)
- **Certified Archivist** - Catalan Archives Association (2019)

## What Drives My Writing

My work is deeply rooted in:

### Historical Authenticity

Every story I write is built on:

- Extensive archival research
- Archaeological evidence
- Primary source documents
- Consultation with expert historians

### Cultural Sensitivity

I approach historical narratives with:

- Respect for diverse perspectives
- Careful attention to historical context
- Collaboration with cultural communities
- Ethical representation of marginalized voices

### Emotional Truth

Beyond facts, I seek to capture:

- The human experience of historical events
- Universal emotions that transcend time periods
- The texture of daily life in past eras
- The connections between past and present

## My Writing Philosophy

> "History lives in the spaces between the official records‚Äîin the letters never sent, the stories passed down through generations, and the silence that speaks volumes."

I focus on:

- **Overlooked Perspectives**: Centering women, minorities, and common people
- **Cultural Continuity**: Showing how past traditions influence the present
- **Emotional Resonance**: Making historical experiences feel immediate and relevant
- **Educational Impact**: Weaving learning naturally into engaging narratives
