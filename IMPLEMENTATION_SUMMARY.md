## 📧 Email Setup Instructions

### Current State:

The mail list currently uses a **mock email service** that logs submissions to the browser console. This shows you exactly what data would be sent.

### To Enable Real Email Sending:

#### Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended)

1. Sign up at [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com)
2. Create a service and template
3. Uncomment the EmailJS code in `src/utils/emailService.ts`
4. Replace placeholder values with your EmailJS credentials
5. Install EmailJS: `npm install @emailjs/browser`

#### Option 2: Formspree

1. Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a form endpoint
3. Uncomment the Formspree code in `src/utils/emailService.ts`
4. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID

#### Option 3: Custom Backend

Implement your own API endpoint and update the `submitToMailList` function.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### TypeScript/Linter Errors:

The current errors are related to missing type definitions and can be resolved by:

   ```

2. **Ensuring React types are properly installed:**

   ```bash
   npm install @types/react @types/react-dom
   ```

3. **If using VS Code:** Restart the TypeScript server (Ctrl+Shift+P → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server")

### Email Integration:

## 📝 Notes

- All content is sample/placeholder data for demonstration
- Email functionality is fully structured but needs service integration
- Markdown parsing supports frontmatter for easy content management
- Search functionality is client-side and very responsive
- All styling uses CSS custom properties for easy theming
